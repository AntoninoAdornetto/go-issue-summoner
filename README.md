## Development Status ðŸš§

This repo is under active development. I am in the early stages of building out the core features. As such, some parts of the program may be missing and change significantly.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Go Issue Summoner is a tool that will streamline the process of creating issues within your code base. It works by scanning source code files for special annotations (that you define and pass into the program via a flag) and automatically creates issues on a source code management platform of your choosing. This process will ensure that no important task or concern is overlooked.

## Core Features

- `Customizable Annotations`: Define your own set of annotations, that you would use in a single or multi line comment to mark tasks, concerns, or areas of code that require attention.

<!-- @TODO Uncomment language support Note in README when more lanagues are added -->

- `Language Agnostic`: Annotations are scanned and discovered by locating single and multi line comments and then parsing the information surrounding the annotation. This process is language agnostic and uses the current file extension (when walking the directory) to determine the the proper syntax for a single or multi line comment. **Note: Additional language support will be added soon**

- `SCM Adapters`: Support multiple source code management platforms. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc...

- `Minimized Context Switching`: Developers can write a quick note in their source code file about the issue and then run the report command. Those details will be pushed to the source code management platform you selected and will allow the developer to continue on with their original task with minimal context switching.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

### Installation

Install using go. (**_Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) on your system first._**)

```sh
go install github.com/AntoninoAdornetto/go-issue-summoner@latest
```

<!-- Install using archive file (**_Helpful if you don't want to install go on your system_**) -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Unix -->
<!---->
<!-- Visit releases page and download the latest version and correct architecture for your system -->
<!---->
<!-- ```sh -->
<!-- # replace X with the correct architecture -->
<!-- tar -xzf go-issue-summoner_X.tar.gz -->
<!---->
<!-- # If you want to make the program executable from anywhere, move to your PATH -->
<!-- sudo mv go-issue-summoner /usr/local/bin -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### Scan Command

Scans your local git project for comments that contain an issue annotation. Issues are objects that are built when scanning the project. In short, they describe a task, concern, or area of code that requires attention. The scan command is a preliminary command that may be used prior to the `report` command. This will give you an idea of the issue annotations that reside in your project. Heck, even if you did not want to use the tool to publish the issues to a source code platform, you could utilize the tool by running the scan command locally to keep track of what items need attention.

- `-a`, `--annotation` The annotation the program will search for. (default annotation is @TODO)

- `-p`, `--path` The path to your local git repository (defaults to your current working directory if a path is not provided)

- `-g`, `--gitignore` The path to your .gitignore file. This is optional, and will default to your current working directory or to the gitignore located at the path you provided from the flag above. You can provide the gitignore file path for projects that you are not scanning. This may be a very niche use case, but it is supported.

- `-m`, `--mode` The two modes are `pending` and `processed`. Meaning that you can scan for annotations that have not been uploaded to a source code management platform, I.E pending, or you can scan for annotations that have been published, I.E processed. Processed annotations will look differently than pending annotations because when issues are reported, the program will update the annotation to include a unique id so the comment can be removed by the program once it has been marked as resolved. (default mode is pending)

- `-v`, `--verbose` Logs detailed information about each issue annotation that was located during the scan.

#### Scan Usage

```sh
issue-summoner scan
```

The command will walk your git project directory and check each source file. It adheres to the rules of your projects .gitignore file and skips entire directories and files when it finds a match. Yes, you do not need to worry about your node_modules folder being scanned! The comment syntax to use for each file is based on the files extension. Most languages are supported and more are to come! Let's take a look at an example that uses a single line comment for a C file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// @TODO implement the main function
int main() {
	printf("Hello world\n");
	return 0;
}
```

Basic usage of the command would result in the following:

![issue-summoner-scan](https://github.com/AntoninoAdornetto/go-issue-summoner/assets/70185688/f9eaef15-ac50-49d1-b8b2-1c0dd72f8393)

We can get a little more information about the annotation by passing the verbose flag `-v` the result would be:

![issue-summoner-scan-verbose](https://github.com/AntoninoAdornetto/go-issue-summoner/assets/70185688/e9dc9ffc-40ff-4e78-b06e-5730e10a5e47)

You may have noticed that there is not a description. This is because single line comments are concise. However, we can be more granular by utilizing a multi line comment:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  /*
   * @TODO implement the main function
   * The main function does nothing useful.
   * Remove the print statement and build something that is useful!
   * */
  printf("Hello world\n");
  return 0;
}
```

The new result using a multi line comment:

![issue-summoner-scan-2](https://github.com/AntoninoAdornetto/go-issue-summoner/assets/70185688/f065c8d5-7a7a-4d61-b8d4-fab388f40fe7)

### Authorize Command

In order to publish issues to a source code management system, we must first authorize the program to allow this. Authorizing will look different for each provider. As of now, I have added support for GitHub. I will be adding more in the near future.

- `-s`, `--scm` The source code management platform to authorize. (default is GitHub).

#### Authorize for GitHub

The [device-flow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow) is utilized to create an access token. The only thing you really need to know here is that when you run the command, you will be given a `user code` in the terminal and your default browser will open to https://github.com/login/device You will then be prompted to enter the user code while the program polls the authorization service for an access token. Once the steps are complete, the program will have all scopes it needs to report issues for you. **Note**: this does grant the program access to both public and private repositories.

```sh
issue-summoner authorize -s github
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [x] `Comment/Tag-Annotation Scanning Engine`: Develop the core engine that scans source code files for user defined tag annotations, such as @TODO for to-do items. It can recognize the file's extension and appropriately handle language specific syntax for both single and multi-line comments.

- [ ] `Authenticate User to submit issues`: Verify and Authenticate a user to allow the program to submit issues on the users behalf.

  - [x] GitHub Device Flow
  - [ ] GitLab
  - [ ] BitBucket
        <br></br>

- [ ] `SCM Adapter`: Implement a basic adapter for issue reporting functionality.

  - [x] GitHub Adapter
  - [ ] GitLab Adapater
  - [ ] BitBucket Adapater

See the [open issues](https://github.com/AntoninoAdornetto/go-issue-summoner/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
